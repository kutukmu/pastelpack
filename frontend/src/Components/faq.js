                  printed on demand. However, if there's an issue with your
                  order, please contact me so I can make it right!

                  Refunds are only offered to customers that receive the wrong
                  items or damaged items. If any of these apply, please contact
                  us at pastelpack0@gmail.com with photos of wrong/damaged items
                  and weâ€™ll sort that out for you. Accepted refunds may take up
                  to 10 business days to be returned back to your card.

                  It'll vary! (Sorry, I know how much everyone hates "it
                  depends", but it depends.). Due to COVID, there is a slight
                  delay on apparel printing within the US - 4-9 business days
